We use a lot of *words* talking about Blockchain, these are some of the most common ones that trip people up.

- **Account Abstraction** - Also known as [EIP/ERC-4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337) is a proposal to change the way accounts are managed within Ethereum which should make it significantly simpler for users to create and retain Ethereum accounts without managing private keys in wallets in the traditional way.
- **Alt-DA** - An "Alternate Data Availability Layer" that stores data outside of Ethereum only posting proofs of that data to Ethereum, this enables significantly cheaper and faster data storage.
- **BIP-39 Wordlist** - a [list of words](https://www.blockplate.com/pages/bip-39-wordlist) which corresponds to numbers used represent a very big number that is the seed phrase for a wallet.
- **Blazor** - a way of building webpages in .NET / C#.
- **Docker** - a lightweight way to run Linux software in an isolated environment on Windows, Mac and Linux.
- **ERC-20** - a common token standard for Fungible Tokens on the Ethereum Virtual Machine. All ERC-20 tokens implement a well-known interface to ensure interoperability. The EVE Token is an example of a ERC-20 Token.
- **ERC-721** - a common token standard for Non-Fungible Tokens on Ethereum Virtual Machine. SmartCharacters and SmartDeployables are both examples of ERC-720 token.
- **Ethereum** - Chain "1" in the Ethereum Ecosystem and the Level 1 chain to all Ethereum Layer 2 chains. Runs the Ethereum Virtual Machine.
- **EVM** - The Ethereum Virtual Machine, the standard virtual machine for Ethereum networks, executes EVM Bytecode / Opcodes which Solidity compiles down to.
- **Forge** - one of the most common development frameworks for Solidity and the Ethereum Virtual Machine.
- **Fungible Token** - a token that can be exchanged and subdivided freely, i.e. 1 ETH is the same as another 1 ETH you can swap them and nothing would change.
- **Garnet** - The OP Stack-based Testnet that CCP uses for Phase 4+ Alpha versions of EVE: Frontier. Garnet and Redstone both have an Alternate Data Availability layer (Alt-DA).
- **JavaScript** - the primary scripting language for the web.
- **Lattice** - the company that builds the Mud Framework and operates the Garnet and Redstone network. They are nice people, go follow them on all the things.
- **Mud Framework** - a framework for building virtual worlds, which itself is a wrapper around Forge.
- **Mud Table** - a two dimensional table of data used by Mud to store row data in a space efficient way.
- **Non-Fungible Token** - a token where each instance of it is not necessarily the same as another, i.e. different NFTs have different attributes.
- **OP Stack** - Suite of software including `op-node` and `op-geth` that allows nodes on an Optimism the chain to validate new blocks and communicate with other nodes. Base, Optimism and Redstone are all examples of OP Stack chains.
- **Optimism** - a Layer-2 chain run by the Optimism Foundation building a series of Layer-2's mostly using Optimistic Rollups.
- **Optimistic Rollups** - a way of leveraging the security of Ethereum without actually using Ethereum for every transaction, instead proofs are rolled up to Ethereum optimistically - i.e. there is a period of time where a proof can be challenged before it is finalised.
- **React** - a way of managing the structure of a HTML web page.
- **Redstone** - the OP Stack-based Mainnet that CCP will likely use for go-live.
- **Solidity** - a high-level language for developing smart contracts for the Ethereum Virtual Machine.
- **TypeScript** - a higher level language that compiles down into JavaScript and adds type-safe conventions.
- **Zero Knowledge Proof** - a cryptographic way of proving that you know something without revealing what you know.
- **ZK Rollups** - rollups which post a Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proof to the Level 1 effectively creating a binding proof that the transaction is valid without requiring a challenge period.
