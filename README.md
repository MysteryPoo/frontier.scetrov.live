This repository represents my notes from nearly a year of learning about [EVE Frontier](https://evefrontier.com/en), Solidity and Mud Framework. I publish it here under a Creative Commons (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0) License in the hope that new developers can get up to speed with developing for this game as quickly as possible.
